 Some of my C# Scripts
 
 If you have v3.0 running, download the conversion stone and install on your server and run it. Clicking the stone will upgrade your SGData.xml file to the later v3.1 format, shutdown your server and replace all the stargate script .cs files with the v3.1 version and restart your server. IMPORTANT NOTE... You will need to remove your ORIGINAL SGData.xml file (your current file of gate locations) to a safe place (Don't delete it just in case) and RENAME the SGData-NEW-FORMAT.xml file to SGData.xml, the v3.1 will read that and run as normal.
